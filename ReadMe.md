# Inter-Process Protocol
The Inter-Process Protocol (I2P) is a mid-level communications protocol for remote procedure calls and inter-process communication that mashes together elements of Open Sound Control (OSC), MIDI, ASCII C0 Control Codes, LISP, artificial intelligence philosophy, and retro computer history. The protocol facilitates function calls with multiple parameters and return values, data serialization/marshalling, message passing, remote process oversight, and interface querying. FreeI2P can run on a microcontroller via Arduino and mbed, or PC in a precompiled C++ library with C interface and bindings for popular languages like Python and C#. I2P is excellent for anything from simple microcontroller projects to advanced robotics. For FreeI2P examples, please see the Kabuki Toolkit.
